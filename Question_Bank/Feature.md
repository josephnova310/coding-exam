# Edit Supplier

Create a **single self-contained HTML file** (HTML + CSS + vanilla JavaScript) to **edit an existing supplier**. The page reads from `localStorage.suppliers` and **auto-populates the form with the selected supplier's data by default**, allowing users to update supplier details. The UI should be **responsive, clean, and purple-themed**.
